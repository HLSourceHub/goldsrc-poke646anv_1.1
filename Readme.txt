	Mouse, Keyboard

Recommended system:

The "Poke646: Anniversary Edition" requires the Steam version of Half-Life (available at http://store.steampowered.com/), running on Windows 7 or newer, and is not compatible with the original CD version of Half-Life (also known as the WON version).


II.  Installation
=================

Step 1:
If you ran any earlier version of the mods under Half-Life on Steam, please go to your Half-Life folder (i.e. "<drive>:\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life") and delete the "poke646" and/or the "vendetta" folder. 

Step 2:
If you're new to Poke646, Steam & Half-Life, first download and install the Steam client (available at http://store.steampowered.com/) and the Steam version of Half-Life (available at http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/).

Step 3:
Exit the Steam client and extract the content of this archive (2 folders named "poke646" & "vendetta") to your Steam Half-Life folder (i.e. "<drive>:\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life").

Step 4:
Restart the Steam client and "Poke646" & "Poke646: Vendetta" should now appear under the "Half-Life Mods" tab in your Steam game library. Both games can be launched from there and switched between via the "Change Game" link from the ingame menu.


III.  Game Information
======================

The release of the "Poke646: Annniversary Edition" on Dec 21st 2016 marks the 15th anniversary of the original "Poke646" release and the 10th anniversary of the "Poke646: Vendetta" sequel release. Both mods form a coherent storyline and span over a total of 42 maps and approximately 4-6 hours of playtime.

The "Poke646: Annniversary Edition" is basically a bundle of both mods, patched to run under the current Steam and Half-Life versions. This edition is designed to replace all other installations and/or patches of the mods, ideally becoming the only downloable edition of the mods over the coming years.

In order to get the full experience of playing Poke646, please start with the hazard course first. This training unit will explain all specific functions of Poke646 and other things that may differ from your standard Half-Life experience.


IV.  General Technical Issues
=============================

A. Driver Issues

DO NOT run Poke646 in software mode. Software mode is not supported by Poke646 and will most likely result in graphical glitches and huge framerate drops.

If you have any problem with the visuals of Poke646, make sure you have the latest version of DirectX installed and check your 3D card manufacturer for the most recent drivers. Poke646 has been tested on both NVidia and ATI cards and should run smooth on any imaginable setup.

B. Game Resolutions

DO NOT run Poke646 in a screen resolution lower than 640x480 (800x600 or higher recommended). If you run a resolution lower than 640x480, you won't be able to follow the storyline properly and miss out parts of the HUD.

C. Sound Problems

If you think the balance between the MP3 soundtrack and the ingame sound is wrong, please adjust the sound effects volume ("Options" -> "Audio") to your needs. The built in MP3 player doesn't have a volume control.

D: Random Crashes

If Poke646 ever decides to crash on you, please try to reproduce the bug in the same place. If it doesn't happen again, it was most likely a problem on your system. However, if the bug persists to appear in the same place more than once, please send a mail with all information about what happened to info@poke646.com so I can try to find a solution and post it in the FAQs on the website.

E: Warranty

The Poke646 team doesn't take any responsibility for crashes, bugs or other damage Poke646 might cause on your system. Poke646 is freely distributed through the internet, therefor we don't have any influence on how the file you downloaded might have been altered or damaged.
