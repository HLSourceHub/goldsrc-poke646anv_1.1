INTRO1
{
At the break of dawn, Damien Reeves was just a
low level technician in the Poke646 organization.
But over the course of one terrifying day, he became
so much more... a fighter, a savior, some would even
call him a hero.

The odds were not in his favor though. Now he finds
himself stranded on the Xen borderworld, betrayed
by his former boss Dr. Sebastian Fuller and left
behind by everyone at Poke646.
}

INTRO2
{
Being the excellent technician he is, Damien
manages to create a stable teleporter signal in
an abandoned Poke646 space shuttle, left behind
on the asteroid, like him.

Damien doesn't know who he can trust anymore,
he can't tell right from wrong, he doesn't even
know where this teleporter might take him...
but there's one thing he knows.

Revenge is a dish best served cold.
